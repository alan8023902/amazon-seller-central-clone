# Amazon Seller Central Dashboard Refactoring Plan

## Overview
I'll completely refactor the Dashboard page to match Amazon Seller Central's pixel-level UI specifications using React + Tailwind CSS only.

## Files to Modify
1. `features/Dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard component
2. `features/LeftColumnComponents.tsx` - Actions and Communications cards
3. `index.css` - Dashboard container styling
4. `layouts/MainLayout.tsx` - Page layout structure

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Global Layout Fixes
- **Dashboard container**: Set left/right padding to 100px
- **Columns**: Ensure left column width 264px, gap 16px
- **Cards**: Standardize all cards to bg-white, border 1px #E3E6E6, radius 8px

### 2. Greeting Row
- Update text to exactly: "Good evening, your account health is"
- Fix Healthy pill styling: 12px text, semibold, padding 2px 8px, rounded-full
- Add small chevron ">" after the pill
- Style right buttons: "Launch Tour" and "Learn More" with height 28px, text 12px

### 3. Actions Card
- Ensure outer card has blue focus ring: ring-2 ring-[#007185] ring-offset-2
- Update header: "Actions" + info icon + right badge "1"
- Simplify body to single inner panel with "Shipment performance" content

### 4. Communications Card
- Ensure it has two sections: Seller Forums and Seller News
- Update section headers with title, "See all" on new line, and kebab button
- Add mock data with 3+ items per section
- Use gray SVG icons for metrics instead of emoji

### 5. Global Snapshot Card
- Update grid to 6 equal columns with vertical dividers
- Fix all text formatting (no camelCase, currency no space)
- Implement each column with specific content:
  - Sales: $49.95 + mini line chart
  - Open Orders: 6 + sub-metrics
  - Buyer Messages: 0 + Inventory Performance Index
  - Featured Offer %: 100% + Global Promotions Sales
  - Seller Feedback: 5.00 stars + Ad Sales
  - Payments: $228.31 + Ad Impressions

### 6. Product Performance Card
- Fix header to two lines: main title + Last 30 days
- Update right controls to single row with specific components
- Standardize table formatting:
  - Header bg #F7F8FA, text 12px gray
  - Column names with spaces (no camelCase)
  - First column with star + thumbnail + title + SKU/ASIN
  - Correct inventory format: "86 FBA"

## Expected Results
- Dashboard page that exactly matches Amazon Seller Central UI
- All components styled according to specifications
- Proper layout with correct padding, gaps, and dimensions
- Accurate typography, colors, and spacing
- Responsive design maintained

## Implementation Approach
1. First, fix the global layout and container styling
2. Then update each component one by one
3. Focus on pixel-perfect alignment and exact text matching
4. Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
5. Ensure no external dependencies are added
6. Test the layout across different screen sizes
