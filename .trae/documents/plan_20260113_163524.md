## Implementation Plan

1. **Create a single TSX file** with both components and a demo wrapper
2. **Define shared Tailwind class strings** as specified in the requirements
3. **Implement ActionsCard** with:
   - Outer card with blue ring for active focus
   - Header with "Actions" text, info icon, and count badge
   - Single inner panel with shipment performance information
4. **Implement CommunicationsCard** with:
   - Two sections: Seller Forums and Seller News
   - Each section with header, see all link, and item list
   - Mock data arrays inside the component as provided
5. **Add a demo wrapper** <LeftColumnDemo> that renders both cards with gap-4 spacing

**Key Points:**
- Use Tailwind CSS only, no external libraries
- Follow exact class names and styles from the spec
- Include mock data arrays inside components
- Ensure code is copy-paste runnable
- Apply the blue ring only to ActionsCard
- Use the exact mock data provided for Seller Forums and Seller News sections
